Injecting Single Interface Implementation with Google Guice
How to DI (@Inject) a single implementation of an Interface into another Class
Via...
1. Explicit bind in Guice module
	a. Create one Interface with getDiscount method declaration (Discountable)
	b. Implementation class for Interface (EarlyBirdDiscount, NightOwlDiscount)
	c. Service class with constructor with Implementation of Interface with @Inject  (Implementation to pickup)and checkout method (CheckoutService)
	d. Main class with main method instanciate GuiceModule here
		use Guice Factory method - 
 	Injector guice = Guice.createInjector(new DiscountGuiceModule());
	e. GuiceModule extends com.google.inject.AbstractModule with protected configure method - binding happened here
2. @ImplementedBy
3. Both 1 and 2 together
